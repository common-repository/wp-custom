<p>Hi! My name is Konstantin Kovshenin (I'm from Russia) and I'm the developer of this plugin. Thanks for downloading and all your feedback!</p>
<h3>What's it for?</h3>
<p>So, why did you download it in the first place? Sounds cool? Did you even read the description? No? Deactive and send to trash. Oh and if you really are interested then I suggest you read this article: <a href="http://kovshenin.com/archives/about-wp-custom-plugin/">The WP-Custom plugin. What's it all about?</a> and also visit the development page of the <a href="http://kovshenin.com/wordpress/plugins/wp-custom/">WP-Custom Plugin</a> for more information, bug reports and feature requests.</p>

<h3>Hey thanks!</h3>
<p>You're welcome! The plugin's still in early development so I'm very very sorry if you encounter any usage problems and I'll fix that as soon as possible as long as you gimme feedback, okay? Thanks for your contribution.</p>
<p>Yours,<br />~ k.</p>
